  - From '../utils/auth' import auth
- Initial application state:
  - formState: an object with two properties, username and password, both with empty string values.
  - currentlySending: a boolean value of false.
  - loggedIn: a function call to auth.loggedIn().
  - errorMessage: an empty string.
- Exported function:
  - Name: homeReducer.
