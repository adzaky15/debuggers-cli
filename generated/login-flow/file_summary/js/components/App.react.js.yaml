File: js/components/App.react.js
Description: 
  This file contains the component 'App' that serves as a skeleton for all pages in the React application. It is responsible for rendering the navigation bar and children components. It also includes some Redux implementation.
Imported Libraries:
  - React
  - Nav.react
  - connect from 'react-redux'
  - auth from '../utils/auth'
Exported:
  - The 'App' component as the default export after connecting it to Redux store using 'connect(select)(App)'.
Redux Implementation:
  - The 'select' function extracts the 'state' and returns it as 'data' property of the component. 
  - The 'App' component is then wrapped by 'connect(select)(App)' to inject the 'dispatch' and 'data' properties into it.
